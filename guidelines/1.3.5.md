# Purpose of text fields

## Does a text input field collect information about the user?<br />&rarr; Use the HTML <code>autocomplete</code> attribute to identify its purpose. For example: email, password, given-name, ...

When an input field collects information **about to the user** (for example, if the input field is collecting the user's name, as opposed to the name of one of their friends), then its purpose needs to be identified in code in ways that can be understood by Assistive Technologies and browsers.

For example, if an HTML `input` field collects the user's first name, adding the `autocomplete="given-name"` attribute lets the browser and screen readers know what the purpose of the input field is.

Note that if the input field was not collecting information about the user themselves (but about one of their friends, for example), it should not have this attribute.

## Requirements

- Using the [HTML 5.2 `autocomplete` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill) on `input` fields that collect information about the user.

**Note:** Remember that you should only add the `autocomplete` attribute to `input`s that collect **information about the user**.

### Why?

- People with language and memory problems or disabilities benefit from the system auto-filling their information.
- People with motor impairments also benefit from not having to fill in forms with the same information when the system can do it for them.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html#dfn-programmatically-determined) when: (Level AA)
>
> - The input field serves a purpose identified in the [Input Purposes for User Interface Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes) section; and
> - The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

### Collecting data about a user using `input` fields the `autocomplete` attribute:

Here's an example of a form collecting data on a user with autocomplete attributes:

```html
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<label for="1">Name</label>
<input type="text" name="1" id="1" autocomplete="name" />
<label for="2">Honorific / Prefix</label>
<input type="text" name="2" id="2" autocomplete="honorific-prefix" />
<label for="3">Given Name</label>
<input type="text" name="3" id="3" autocomplete="given-name" />
<label for="4">Additional Name</label>
<input type="text" name="4" id="4" autocomplete="additional-name" />
<label for="5">Family name</label>
<input type="text" name="5" id="5" autocomplete="family-name" />
<label for="6">Honorific Suffix</label>
<input type="text" name="6" id="6" autocomplete="honorific-suffix" />
```

**Note:** Remember that you should only add the `autocomplete` attribute to `input`s that collect **information about the user**.

### Common mistakes

- Building a form that collects information about the user without the autocomplete (or other semantic that identifies the purpose of the input).
- Putting the `autocomplete` attribute on input fields that collect information that is not about the user themselves (for example, if the input field is for collecting information about a friend of the user)
