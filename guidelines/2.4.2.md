## Summary

**Give every page a unique and helpful title that indicates the purpose of the page.**

Each page must have a unique title that indicates its topic or purpose.

---

## Requirements

* Each page has a title that is unique within the app/website;
* Each page has a title that indicates its topic or purpose.

### Common mistakes

* The page title is not unique within the website/app;
* The page title does not indicate its topic or purpose;
* The page title isn't updated when the main content of the page changes
  * This mistake is common in Single Page Apps

### Why?

This ensures that people with cognitive disabilities can quickly orientate themselves within the service and identify the purpose of the page without interpreting its entire contents.

The page/screen title is often the first thing people will see or hear and acts as a confirmation of where they have arrived at, helping people orientate themselves within websites and apps. It is particularly helpful for vision impaired users who cannot perceive the whole page/screen at once.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.2 Page Titled:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html) [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html#webpagedef) have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A)

This [applies to native apps](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/#navigation-mechanisms-title) by replacing "Web pages" with "Screens".

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Provide titles for each web page that you design
  * The page title is what appears in the browser's tab for that website, and what gets announced by screen readers when the page loads
* Generally, the page title should be the same as the page's main heading (the unique `<h1>` on the page)
* For pages that show dynamic results (like product research results), include the search query at the beginning of the page title, followed by the name of the site
  * Good example: 'Red shoes – Google'
  * Less good example: 'Amazon.co.uk: Red shoes'

## Guidance for Web

* Each page has a unique and descriptive title, provided via the `<title>` element.
* The `<title>` element indicates that the page is part of a website;
* In single page applications, the title is updated every time a new view is loaded.

### Update the page title in Single Page Applications

From a user's perspective, it doesn't matter to them whether they're visiting a Single Page App or not. They expect page titles to be updated to reflect the main content of the page as it changes.

* The simplest way to update the page's title in a Single Page App is to update the value of `document.title` when the component that displas your page's main content mounts or gets updated.
* In React, you can use [Dan Abramov's React Document Title component](https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title) if you prefer a declarative approach.
