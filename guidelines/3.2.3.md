## Navigation links that appear on multiple pages must appear in the same order.

When navigation links are repeated on multiple pages, the order in which they appear on each page should be consistent.

## Requirements

- Navigational items that are repeated on multiple pages of a website (e.g. Search field, social media links, related links panels) are positioned in a consistent order across the website/app.

### Why?

This makes it easier for people to learn how to navigate the website/app, and it enables people to develop strategies (like using screen reader shortcuts)for more efficient navigation.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.2.3 Consistent Navigation:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html) Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#webpagedef) within a [set of Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#set-of-web-pagesdef) occur in the [same relative order](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#samerelorderdef) each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html) with techniques and examples.
