## Summary

**Make sure that keyboard-only users can clearly see which interactive control is focused when they tab through them.**

It should be easy to tell which element has [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).

---

## Requirements

- When actionable items receive the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus), their visual appearance changes (e.g. a box appears around them, links become underlined, the colour of the text or of the background changes).

### Related requirements

- See the ['Non-text contrast'](./1.4.11.md) for requirements about the contrast of the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicators.

### Common mistakes

- The keyboard focus indicator has been suppressed.

### Why?

- Sighted keyboard and switch device users track where they are on a page/screen as they navigate through focusable elements, similar to using a remote control with a TV interface.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.7 Focus Visible:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

- Do not remove the browser's default focus indicator unless you're also providing an alternative [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicator.

### Doing better

#### Include keyboard focus state for all interactive components in your designs

- Do not depend on a browser's default visible states for [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).
  - Their colour may clash with your design or blend into the background colour.
  - Some browser's default focus indicators have very poor contrast.

## Guidance for Web

### Do not disable focus styles, unless you've already implemented improved focus styles

By default, native HTML elements have a visual focus indicator provided by the browser. Therefore, links and focusable elements must not have their outline suppressed via CSS, unless a custom focus indicator is provided.

#### Failure example

```html
// Never do this, // unless you’ve already replaced the default focus outline
with better custom focus styles!

<style>
  a {
    outline: none; /* or outline: 0;*/
  }
</style>

<!--  -->

<a href="..."> Next </a>
```

### To prevent keyboard focus styles from appearing when users click interactive elements, use the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html)

#### What's the use case?

Browsers' default focus styles don't appear when people click or tap buttons or links.
However, if you define your own enhanced styles using the CSS `:focus` pseu-do class, those styles will appear on click/tap as well.

Sometimes clients or designers don’t like to see a focus ring appear on a custom button or element when it gets clicked.
They might say to a developer: “Get rid of that focus ring”.

But if you got rid of focus rings entirely, the interface would become unusable for keyboard users.

#### How the `:focus-visible` CSS selector solves that problem

Using the `:focus-visible` CSS selector allows you to …

- disable focus ring styles on elements when they are focused via mouse / touch
- … while leaving them intact when that element gets focused using the keyboard or in code.

In itself, `:focus-visible` doesn’t have any accessibility benefit. Just keeping the focus visible for all users is fine from an accessibility perspective.
But it’s a good way to handle clients or designers’ requests for the focus ring to be removed for mouse or touch users, which would disable keyboard users.

#### You need a polyfill to use `:focus-visible`

As of Feb 2020 `:focus-visible` is only supported by default in Firefox.
But the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html) is small and robust.
