## Summary

**Make sure that structures and relationships that are conveyed visually (like distinct sections within a page, or a label next to a checkbox) are also identified in code.**

When content structures like tables, lists and headings are communicated visually, they must also be communicated in ways that assistive technologies can understand.

---

## Requirements

### Requirements for both native and web

* Headings are presented using the correct elements or properties in code;
* Form fields have properly associated labels;
* Form fields with format requirements or other additional information have properly associated hints

### Web only requirements

* Tabular data is presented using the correct markup
* Lists of items are presented using the correct markup
* Sets of radio buttons or checkboxes have a `<fieldset>` element to group them together, and a `<legend>` element to provide a label for the group

### Why?

This ensures that the structure of the content that's conveyed visually by the designs is also available to screen reader, screen magnifier and speech recognition tool users.

Here's a [fun video illustrating the difference this makes for screen reader users](https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile/structure/headings).

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## Guidance for iOS

### Setting a view as a heading (e.g. table section headings or screen titles):

```swift
headingLabel.isAccessibilityElement = true
headingLabel.accessibilityTraits = [.heading]
```

### Setting a custom view as a search field:

```swift
customSearchField.isAccessibilityElement = true
customSearchField.accessibilityTraits = [.searchField]
```

### Setting a custom view as a tab bar:

```swift
customTabBar.isAccessibilityElement = true
customTabBar.accessibilityTraits = [.tabBar]
```

### You can combine traits if your element needs it:

```swift
view.accessibilityTraits = [.heading, .updatesFrequently]
```

### Providing a label for input fields:

```swift
textField.accessibilityLabel = "First Name"
```

## Guidance for Web

This section needs a review and more content. [Contribute or report issues via Github](https://github.com/theappbusiness/accessibility-guidelines/issues/59) (preferred) or [email](mailto:jeanfrancois@theappbusiness.com).

### Forming a correct headings structure

* Code headings with heading mark-up (`<h1> - <h6>`).
* Assign headings the correct heading level (i.e. the main page heading is coded with `<h1>`, its subheadings are coded with `<h2>`, subheadings of any `<h2>` heading are coded with `<h3>`, etc.).
* Text that does not represent a heading should not coded with heading mark-up.
  * Use CSS classes rather than `<h1> - <h6>` elements to style text that don't represent headings for sections of the page.

```html
<h1>Main heading for the page</h1>

<h2>Heading for the first top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the first top level section</h3>
<h4>Heading for a sub-sub-section, nested under that sub-section</h4>

<h2>Heading for the second top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the second top level section</h3>
```

#### Example: A heading structure for a weather website

```html
<h1>Local Weather</h1>
 <h2>Today's Forecast</h2>
 <h2>Tomorrow Forecast</h2>
  <h3>Tomorrow's Allergy Forecast</h3> 
```

##### Failure example

```html
<div class="heading">Local Weather</div>
<div class="subheading">Today's Forecast</div>
<div class="subheading">Tomorrow Forecast</div>
<div class="subheading2">Tomorrow's Allergy Forecast</div>
```

#### More guidance on forming a correct headings structure

* [Headings tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
* [Semantic structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/) article by WebAIM

### Forming a data table

* A cell that is a row header should be coded with `<th scope="row">`;
* A cell that is a column header should be coded with `<th scope="col">`;
* Use `<th scope="rowgroup">` and `<th scope="colgroup">` if the same header applies to multiple rows or columns, but you should avoid complex tables like that as they are hard to understand for screen reader users;
* Cells containing data are coded with `<td>`.

* Avoid making complex data tables (i.e. tables containing several rows and/or columns of headers, irregular and multi-level headers).
  * If you can't avoid making a complex data table, each data cell should be associated with all its headers via the `scope`, `id` and `headers` attributes.

* A title should be provided for all data tables via the `<caption>` element (or `aria-labelledby` with the `id` of a `h1-h6` element directly introducing the table).

#### Example of a basic table structure

```html
<table>
	<caption>Short descriptive name for the table</caption>

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 1</th>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 2</th>
			<th scope="col">Column Heading 3</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Row Heading 1</th>
			<td>Cell value for row 2, column 2</td>
			<td>Cell value for row 2, column 3</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Row Heading 2</th>
			<td>Cell value for row 3, column 2</td>
			<td>Cell value for row 3, column 3</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

#### Do not use HTML tables for layout out content

* The use of layout tables (i.e. tables solely used to position items on the screen) should be avoided. Use CSS to position the content instead.
* When layout tables cannot be avoided, their source code should contain the ARIA `role="presentation"` attribute, and should not include the `<th>` and `<caption>` elements, and the `headers`, `axis`, `scope` and `summary` attributes.

* [Intentionally Hiding Semantics with the presentation Role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#presentation_role) in the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide

### Forming lists

* Lists should be coded with the most appropriate HTML list element:
  * <ul> for unordered lists;
  * <ol> for ordered lists;
  * <dl> for description lists.

* List mark-up should be used to accurately describe the structure of lists.
  * For example, do not split items of a same list into two separate `<ul>` elements.

* Content that does not represent a list should not be coded with list mark-up.

#### Example of an ordered list

```html
<ol>
	<li>List value 1</li>
	<li>List value 2</li>
</ol>
```

#### Example of a description list

```html
<dl>
	<dt>Title 1</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
		<dd>List value 2</dd>
	<dt>Title 2</dt>
		<dd>List value 1</dd>
</dl>
```

#### More guidance on forming lists

* ['Lists' section of the Content Structure tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#lists) by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

### Associating form controls with labels, and associating related form controls

* Form fields that have a visible label should be associated with their label in the HTML code (via the `id` and `for` attributes).

```html
<label for='first-name'>First Name</label>
<input name='first-name' />
```

* Radio buttons and checkboxes are associated with their label via the `id` and `for` attributes, are grouped together with `<fieldset>` and the question preceding each group is coded with `<legend>`.

#### Common mistakes

* Using the `placeholder` attribute to provide an ['Accessible Name'](./definitions.md#accessible-name) for a text `input` field. (The `placeholder` attribute is not well supported by some browsers and assistive technologies combinations, and shouldn't be used for labelling text fields).

### Use HTML5 sectioning elements to describe document structure and outline different parts of the page

* Identify the purpose of each section of content on a page using HTML5 sectioning elements. These create 'Landmark regions' that help screen reader users navigate within a page.

| Element | What it means | Implicit landmark `role` |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `<header>` | A section of content that is repeated at the top of all/several pages | `role="banner"` if it is a direct child of `<body>` |
| `<nav>` | An area containing navigation links | `role="navigation"` |
| `<search>` | A component that allows users to search content on the site | `role="search"` |
| `<main>` | The main content of the page (i.e. not header, navigation or footer elements or complementary content) | `role="main"` |
| `<form>` | A form | `role="form"` if it has an [Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessible-name) |
| `<section>` | A section of content that you want added in the list of Landmark regions | `role="region"` if it has an [Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessible-name) |
| `<aside>` | Content that complements the content in the `main` area, but would also make sense on its own | `role="complementary"` |
| `<footer>` | Information about the page (such as copyright) | `role="contentinfo"` if it is a direct child of `<body>` |

* Make sure that every text node on the page is a descendant of a HTML sectioning element.
  * Otherwise screen reader users who navigate pages by landmarks would never find it.

* If a same HMTL sectioning element and/or equivalent ARIA landmark `role` is used multiple times on a page, make sure that each instance has a unique [Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessible-name).

#### Example

```html
<header>
  <div id="logo">...</div>

  <nav aria-label="BBC">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">News</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Weather</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Sport</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Travel</a></li>
		...
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <nav aria-label="News">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">UK</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">World</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Business</a></li>
  		...
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
 <h1>Pisa rankings: Why Estonian pupils shine in global tests</h1>

  ...
</main>

<aside> ... </aside>

<footer>
    <p>BBC 2016</p>
    <ul> ... </ul>
</footer>  
```

##### Failure example

```html
<!-- Do not do this -->
<div id="header">
  <div id="logo">...</div>

  <div id="nav" aria-label="BBC">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">News</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Weather</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Sport</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Travel</a></li>
		...
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="nav2" aria-label="News">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">UK</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">World</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Business</a></li>
  		...
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="content">
 <h1>Pisa rankings: Why Estonian pupils shine in global tests</h1>

  ...
</div>

<div id="related_content"> ... </div>

<div id="footer">
    <p>BBC 2016</p>
    <ul> ... </ul>
</div>  
```
