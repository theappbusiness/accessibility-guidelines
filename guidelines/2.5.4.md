## Summary

**If a feature uses the device's motion (like shaking or tilting), make sure that responses to these motions can be turned off, and that the feature can be used in another way.**

If you've implemented any feature that responds to moving or shaking the device (like shake to undo), make sure that the same functionality is available in other ways (like pressing a button), and that responses to motions can be disabled.

---

## Requirements

* Do not use the device motion events to activate any functionality. Or, if you do:
  * Ensure that alternative means of input exist when using device motion sensor input.
  * Provide a user preference to disable motion actuation (ie. responses to the device's motion).
  * Support Operating System features which allow the user to disable motion actuation.

### Why?

This helps people who:
* may be unable to perform tilting, shaking, or gesturing to use an interface;
* may have their device mounted to a mobility aid in a fixed position;
* move or shake involuntarily.

Fixing this will ensure users:
* can still operate all functionality by other means;
* won't trigger functionalities without meaning to.

### Common mistakes

* A functionality that can only be activated by moving, shaking or tilting the device. For example: 
  * When inputting text on an iPhone, shaking the device shows a dialog where you can undo the text input. That dialog can be disabled, but there's no other way to cancel the last action.
* The user is unable to disable motion actuation. For example:
  * Imagine an app where users can tilt their device to scroll down a page, and there's way to disable that response to tilting.
  
### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.5.4 Motion Actuation:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html) [Functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html#dfn-functionality) that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html#dfn-user-interface-component) and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when: (Level A)
>
> * **Supported Interface**: The motion is used to operate functionality through an [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html#dfn-accessibility-supported) interface;
> * **Essential**: The motion is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html#dfn-essential) for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html) with techniques and examples.
