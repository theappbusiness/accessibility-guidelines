## Summary

**Make sure every task can be completed using just a keyboard.**

It must be possible for someone using a keyboard to complete all tasks in a website or app. This ensures that people with mobility impairments who do not use a mouse can successfully complete their goals.

---

## Requirements

- All actionable components can be reached and activated using the keyboard alone.

### Why?

- This ensures that people with mobility or dexterity impairments who do not use a mouse can successfully complete their goals.

- Many people don't rely on a mouse, trackpad or touchscreen to use websites:

  - People who have developed Repetitive Strain Injuries or Arthritis;
  - Screen reader users;
  - Computer power users find keyboard keys and shortcuts to navigate the web.

- Making a website or app accessible with a keyboard also ensures that it is accessible with other input devices that emulate keyboards, like Switch devices or Sip-and-puff devices.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.1.1 Keyboard:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html) All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#functiondef) of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#keybrd-interfacedef) without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)
>
> Note 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
>
> Note 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

### Native HTML interactive elements are keyboard accessible out of the box

- Use native HTML elements that provide keyboard access automatically;
- For inactive elements, ensure focus is disabled for controls that support the `disabled` attribute.

### If you don't make use of HTML interactive elements, you need to implement keyboard accessibility yourself

- If you create an interactive element yourself, make it focusable with the 'Tab' key with `tabindex="0"`. When this element is disabled set `tabindex="-1"` to remove it from the [tab order](./definitions.md#tab-order).
- Also make sure that you implement responses to keyboard presses that users expect. Look at the keyboard support and focus management guidance in the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/), which covers many common user interface design patterns.

  One of the [Rules of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#NOTES) is that:

  > "All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard."

### Hide hidden or off-screen elements for keyboard users and screen reader users too

- Hidden content (that is off-screen like a side-drawer, or behind other content such as a pop-over, for example), should not be navigable for users of assistive technology as they may think they can interact with this content.
  - Use `aria-hidden="true"` and `tabindex="-1"` on each element that would otherwise be focusable, or the [`inert` attributed, which needs to be polyfilled](https://github.com/WICG/inert), on an ancestor element.

### Common mistakes

- A custom widget has been created, but the necessary keyboard support has not been provided. For example:
  - buttons created using `span` or `div` elements rather than `button` or `input` elements
  - links created using the `span` or `div`, rather than the `a` element
  - links using a `a` element but without a URL for their `href` attribute, or if `preventDefault()` has been used
- An `<a>` element has been used as the basis for a button, but the additional keyboard interaction (activation with the space key) has not been provided;
- The `tabindex` attribute has been used on an element with a value of `-1` to mistakenly remove it from the [tab order](./definitions.md#tab-order).

### Example: A link with an image

```html
<!-- standard element that is interactive by default -->
<a href="..."><img src="back.jpg" alt="back" /></a>
```

#### Failure example

```html
<!-- clickable image that is not keyboard accessible -->
<img src="back.jpg" alt="back" onclick="myClickEvent();" />
```

### Example: A carousel that is keyboard accessible

A carousel that supports swiping left and right touch events such as touchstart, touchend, and touchmove can supplement these gestures with keyboard access using buttons, or by watching key presses:

```html
<button onClick="...">Previous</button> <button onClick="...">Next</button>
```

#### Failure example

Listening for touch gestures without providing equivalent control via keyboard:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  // perform some action on touch
</script>

...

<div
  ontouchstart="touchStart(event);"
  ontouchmove="touchMove(event);"
  ontouchend="touchEnd(event);"
  ontouchcancel="touchCancel(event);"
>
  <!-- Carousel content -->
</div>
```
