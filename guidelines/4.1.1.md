## Summary

**Make sure the code of each page does not contain errors that are known to cause conflicts with assistive technologies (such as incorrect nesting of elements, or duplicate `id`s).**

---

## Requirements (Web-only)

* HTML elements have complete start and end tags;
* HTML elements are nested according to their specifications;
* HTML elements do not contain duplicate attributes;
* Any `id`s are unique across the HTML page.

### Common mistakes

*   HTML elements are not well formed (opened and closed properly);
*   HTML id attributes use duplicate values within the same page;

### Why?

This ensures that content and functionality is presented in a way that works reliably across all supported browsers and assistive technologies.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**4.1.1 Parsing:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html) In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

### Checking whether you're nesting elements with ARIA `role` attributes correctly

* If you're using the ARIA `role` attribute, look at the `role`'s definition in the [W3C ARIA 1.1 specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions) to check whether you're nesting elements with that role correctly.
