## Summary

**Provide captions for videos that are pre-recorded.**

Pre-recorded video content (like instructional videos, ads or interviews) must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video.

---

## Requirements

* All pre-recorded video content has captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video;
* Captions include all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio part of the video.

### Common mistakes

* The video does not have synchronised captions;
* The video has captions but they do not include all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio content of the video;
* The video has captions but they are not synchronised with the audio content of the video.

### Why?

This ensures that the information communicated by the audio part of the video is available to people who can't hear it.
