## Summary

**For audio content that has no video (like a podcast), provide a transcript.**

Audio-only content that communicates information (like a podcast) should have a text transcript.

---

## Requirements

- A text transcript is available (on the same page or on a page linked from the page containing the media) for any audio-only content (e.g. podcasts).

### Common mistakes

- Audio-only content that communicates information does not have a text transcript;
- The text transcript for audio-only content does not include all spoken dialogue and sound effects;
- The text transcript for audio-only content is not clearly labelled as such.

### Why?

This ensures that the information is available to people who cannot hear.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) For [prerecorded](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#prerecordeddef) [audio-only](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#audio-onlydef) and prerecorded [video-only](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#video-onlydef) media, the following are true, except when the audio or video is a [media alternative for text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#multimedia-alt-textdef) and is clearly labeled as such: (Level A)

> - **Prerecorded Audio-only**: An [alternative for time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#alt-time-based-mediadef) is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.
> - **Prerecorded Video-only**: Either an alternative for time-based media or an audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded video-only content.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.
