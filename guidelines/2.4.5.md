# Multiple ways to find a page

## Summary

**Give people different ways of finding each page (like searching or browsing links), unless the page is a step in a process.**

There must be different ways for people to locate and navigate to each page – unless the page is a step in a process (like a checkout process for example).

---

## Requirements

* Ensure that each page can be found and navigated to in more than one ways.
  * In addition to navigation menus, the website/app should contain a 'Search' functionality and/or a site map (for large websites), and/or an A-Z index of pages (for small websites).

### Why?

Different people will have different preferences for how to navigate a website/app and find the content they're looking for. For example: 
* someone with a cognitive disability may prefer to browse categories to locate content;
* someone using magnification may prefer to use search instead of scrolling through a lengthy navigation block.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
