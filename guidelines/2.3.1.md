## Requirements

- Content does not flash more than three times a second.

### Why?

- Visual flicker, flashing and strobe lighting can affect anyone, but some users will be more susceptible than others.
- Symptoms may include eyestrain, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, migraine, and nausea.
- Users with medical conditions such as Ménière's or photosensitive epilepsy can be severely affected, experiencing vertigo, hearing loss and seizures.

A well-documented example of the effects of flicker is [Pokémon Shock – this article is safe to view](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/40269.stm).

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html) [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html#webpagedef) do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html#flash-def) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html#general-thresholddef). (Level A)
