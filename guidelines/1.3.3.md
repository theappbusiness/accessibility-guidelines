## Summary

**If you give tips or instructions, do not assume that users can perceive colour, size, shape, sound or the location of elements on screen.**

Instructions must not depend on sensory characteristics like shape, size, colour, or location.

---

## Requirements

- Do not use shape, size, colour or visual location to communicate instructions.

### Common mistakes

- An instruction tells users to "Click the green button";
- An instruction tells users to "Use the menu on the left of the page";
- An instruction tells users they can "Find more information in the square box";
- Users are told that "Instructions are in the right-hand column";
- Users are told that "A beeping sound indicates you may continue".

### Why?

This ensures that instructions can be understood by users who are unable to see or recognise information communicated using sensory characteristics.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html) Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-understanding.html) with techniques and examples.
