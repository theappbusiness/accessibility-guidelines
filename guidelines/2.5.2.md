## Summary

**Make sure that custom buttons or links do not activate as soon as they are touched, so that users can slide their finger or mouse away to cancel the action.**

---

## Requirements

- Interactive elements should only get activated when users release their tap/click, not as soon as they touch the element or press the mouse button down.

### Why?

If an interactive control fires as soon as it is touched, it causes difficulties for people with visual disabilities, cognitive disabilities, motor impairments, and many others.

It is better when there is a way to ‘undo’ or change your mind (for example, by dragging your mouse or finger away after having clicked or touched a control). This avoids accidentally triggering things on a page.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html) For [functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-functionality) that can be operated using a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-single-pointer), at least one of the following is true: (Level A)
>
> - **No Down-Event**: The [down-event](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-down-event) of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
>
> - **Abort or Undo**: Completion of the function is on the [up-event](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-up-event), and a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-mechanism) is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
>
> - **Up Reversal**: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
>
> - **Essential**: Completing the function on the down-event is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#dfn-essential). (Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

- Do not design buttons or interactive elements that trigger their associated functionality as soon as they are touched, or as soon as the user has press the mouse button down.

---

## Guidance for Web

### Use `click` or `mouse-up` events, not `mouse-down` events

Using click events will only trigger the event on release.
