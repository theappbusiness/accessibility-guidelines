# Use of colour

## Does the page use colour to convey information?<br />&rarr; Also communicate that information in a way that doesn't assume people can distinguish colours.

Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information.

For example, don't just colour alone to:

- to identify form fields with invalid entries;
- to identify the current step in a step indicator;
- to distinguish between areas of a map;
- to distinguish between lines on a graph.

## Requirements

- Colour alone is not used to convey information (e.g. to identify form fields with invalid entries or the current step in a step indicator) or to distinguish between areas of a map or graph. Additional visual cues are used to provide the same information (e.g. icons, shapes, patterns, text).

  - Text identified by colour as having special meaning has another indicator - a visible border and label, underline or other visual effect.
  - Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences - hatching patterns or directly applied labels.

- All links within blocks of text are underlined, and no other content on the page is underlined.
  - If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they are hovered by the mouse pointer and receive [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).

### Why?

- This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, or who have difficulty telling different colours apart, understand the content and user interface.
- Colours can be difficult to distinguish in bright sunlight.
- Screen readers do not detect colour.
- Some users will change colour settings for their whole computer, such as applying a tint to help with reading.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.1 Use of Color:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

Colour is often used to show:

- a tab is selected,
- a link is available,
- text is an error message,
- emphasis,
- charts and graphics, or
- other meaningful information.

Additional visual and non-visual methods of identifying information or meaning must be applied to complement the use of colour:

- Visual cues could be:
  - text complementing colours;
  - text styles (such as underline, bold or italic);
  - patterns (in graphs or infographics, for example);
  - icons with suitable alternative text;
  - border-with changes (to identify that a text input field is in focus, for example);
  - ...
- Non-visual cues, which are programmatically available to assistive technologies, could be:
  - visually hidden text;
  - HTML element tags (such as `aria-disabled` for the Web);
  - suitable ['Accessible Names'](./definitions.md#accessibility-name) for elements;
  - ...

### Common mistakes

- A form uses only colour to indicate a required field.
- Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.
- Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour and the colour may not vary from the main body text.
- Text alternatives that do not include information conveyed by colour differences in the original image.
- The error state of a input field is only identified by changing the colour of its border.

### How to style links

- It's best for all links within blocks of text to be underlined, and no other content on the page to be underlined.
- If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they receive the mouse hover and keyboard focus.
  - Note that this method doesn't help users using touch screen devices
- Links in a navigation menu do not need underlining, as their presence of a navigation menu makes it obvious that they're links.
