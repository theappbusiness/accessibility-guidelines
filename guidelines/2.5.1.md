## Summary

**Do not require complex gestures or using more than one finger to do things.**

Make sure that users can do everything without needing to use multi-touch (like pinching, or swiping with several fingers), or following a complex path with their finger.

---

## Requirements

- If a feature requires the user of several fingers at the same time, make sure that the user interface offers another way to achieve the same result using just one finger.
- If a feature requires users to drag a finger along a path that's more complex than just going directly from A to B, make sure that the user interface offers another way to achieve the same result without needing to do that.

### Common mistakes

- Requiring users to perform complex gestures to do things.
- Requiring users to use several fingers at the same time.

### Why?

Some disabled users may need simple inputs or gestures to complete tasks and make selections. Complex movement or gestures requiring dexterity or accuracy may be hard for them.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.5.1 Pointer Gestures:**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html) All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html#dfn-functionality) that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html#dfn-single-pointer) without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html#dfn-essential). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

### Examples

- Google Maps uses a 'pinch-to-zoom' gesture. But the same result can be achieved by clicking the '+' button.
- macOS has trackpad gestures that use several fingers. But the same results can be achieved using just the mouse.
