# Name, Role and State

## Assistive technologies should be able to understand the name, role and state of user interface elements.

Every user interface components that users can interact with should convey an '[Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessibility-name)', what type of component it is (for example "tab", "switch" or "heading"), and its current state to assistive technologies.

Native HTML elements generally provide roles and properties by default. But custom-built ARIA elements will require those accessibility roles and properties to be set.

## Requirements

- All interactive components have an '[Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessibility-name)';
- All interactive components communicate what type of component they are to assistive technologies;
- All interactive components communicate information about their state.

---

## Why this matters

Users of assistive technology, such as screen readers, rely on accessibility properties such as role, name, value, and state to be set appropriately in order to know how to identify and interact with an element or object.

Following this guidelines ensures that screen readers and speech-input software understand ...

- the purpose of every interactive component ("button" or "tab" for example);
- how to identify it ("Submit" for example);
- what state it is in ("expanded" or "selected" for example).

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) For all [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#user-interface-componentdef) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#namedef) and [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#roledef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#programmaticallydetermineddef); states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#programmaticallysetdef); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#useragentdef), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#atdef). (Level A)

## Guidance for Web

### Requirement 1: Ensuring that UI components have an accessible name

Every user interface components that users can interact with needs to have a name that assistive technologies (like screen readers or speech-input software) can understand.

That name is called the 'Accessible Name'. (In the official Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, that name is just called '[name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name)').

For example:

- In a 'Submit' button, the text 'Submit' provides the name of the button.
- The name of a button represented by a magnifying glass icon might be 'Search'. In this example, the word 'Search' name might not be visible on the screen, but the button still needs a name. That name can be set in code (using `aria-label` for the Web for example).

#### Where does the 'Accessible Name' of a UI components come from?

An interactive UI component might be given an Accessibility Name in a number of ways:

1. **from its content** (like in the 'Submit' button example above);
2. **from a visible label** it is associated with in code (in HTML this might be by associating an `input` element with a `label` element, or by using `aria-labelledby`);
3. **from a property** set in code (like `aria-label="Search"`).

#### For `<iframe>` elements

- Any `<iframe>` element used on the page should include a `title` attribute that accurately describes the frame content (e.g. "Travel form").
  - This is important because some browsers and screen reader combinations won't recognise the iframe content page's `<title>` element as a source for the iframe's '[Accessible Name](./definitions.md#accessibility-name)' on your page.

##### Common mistakes

- An `<a>` or `<button>` element contains no text content, and so has no accessible name;
- A form field has no associated `<label>` element, and so has no accessible name;
- A `<iframe>` element used in the source code of the page doesn't include a `title` attribute that accurately describes the frame content.

### Requirement 2: Ensuring that Assistive Technologies can understand what type of component a UI component is

#### Coding of user interface components using native HTML controls

- Links, buttons and form fields should be implemented as native HTML controls (e.g. `<a>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`), rather than as custom controls (e.g. using `<div>`, `<span>` elements and scripting that replicated the built-in behaviour of native HTML controls).

- When standard HTML controls do not exist (and only then), use generic HTML elements and provide equivalents via ARIA and via a method that does not require ARIA.

##### ARIA Use case 1: If you need to fix HTML that has the wrong (or missing) semantics

Most HTML elements have an implied 'role', that communicate what type of component it is to Assistive Technologies. For example:

- a `button` element has an implicit role of `button`;
- an `a` element with an `href` attribute has an implicit role of `link`;
- a `li` element has an implicit role of `listitem`;
- a `dd` element has an implicit role of `definition`;
- some HTML elements like `div` and `span` do not convey any role to assistive technologies.

  See the [W3C 'ARIA in HTML' document](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#document-conformance-requirements-for-use-of-aria-attributes-in-html) to see the implicit roles of other HTML elements.

If incorrect HTML element was used to build a component, or if a `div` or `span` has been used where something more meaningful like a `button` or `a href="..."` should have been used, you can do two things:

1. In almost every case, the best response is to fix the HTML if you can, so it conveyes the right semantics, rather than using ARIA. See the [First rule of ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#firstrule) in the [W3C Using ARIA document](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#NOTES).
2. If you really can't fix the HTML itself, you might be able to fix the element's semantics using ARIA. Please only do this if you know what you're doing with ARIA _and_ if you're also testing the result yourself with a screen reader.

##### ARIA use case 2: If you need to build an interactive component that HTML semantics can't express

Many common interactive components can be expressed with HTML alone. For example:

- a link can be expressed with a `a` element with an `href="..."` attribute
- a button can be expressed with a `button` element or a `input` element with `type="button"`
- a group of radio buttons can be expressed with the `fieldset`, `legend` and `input type="radio"` elements

But other very common interactive elements can't be semantically expressed with HTML alone. For example:

- HTML doesn't have any 'tab' element. So if you want to create a tabbed user interface that screen reader users can understand, you'll need to use the ARIA `tablist`, `tab` and `tabpanel` roles on top of `ul`, `li`, `a` and `div` or `section` elements.
- HTML has a `dialog` element, but it's not well supported. So, as of November 2019, if you want to build a modal dialog, you should use a `div` and add `role="dialog"` as well as `aria-modal="true`. The button triggering the modal should have `aria-haspopup="true"`.

The HTML code of custom controls (e.g. sliders, tabs, accordions) should the right ARIA attributes to describe their role and status (e.g. tab, slider, selected, expanded, collapsed).

#### Common mistakes

- Using ARIA `role` without implementing the keyboard support that is implied that by role (see example further below);
- A `<div>` or `<span>` has been used as the basis for an interactive component, but ARIA `role` has not been used to identify the purpose of the component (or its constituent parts);
- A set of tabs is created using `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<a>` elements, but the ARIA `role` attribute has not been used to provide the `tablist`, `tab`, and `tabpanel` roles;
- An `<a>` element has been used as the basis for a button, but the ARIA `button` role has not been applied.

#### Example

```html
<!-- Example 1 - standard control -->
<input type="checkbox" id="c1" /><label for="c1">Remember me</label>

<!-- Example 2 - ARIA supported tree view with fall-back -->
<ul role="tree">
  <li aria-level="0" aria-expanded="true" role="treeitem">
    <a href="...">TV Shows <span class="offscrn"> - Expanded</span></a>
    <ul>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">Comedy</a></li>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">Drama</a></li>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">Sports</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="0" aria-expanded="true" role="treeitem">
    <a href="...">Radio Shows <span class="offscrn"> - Expanded</span></a>
    <ul>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">News</a></li>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">Soap</a></li>
      <li aria-level="1" role="treeitem"><a href="...">Sports</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

##### Failure example

```html
<!-- Don't do this -->

<!-- Example 1 - non-standard control -->
<div><img src="chkbx" alt="checkbox" />Remember me</div>

<!-- Example 2 - inaccessible tree view -->
<div>
  <div onClick="toggle();">
    TV Shows
    <div>
      <div class="indent">Comedy</div>
      <div class="indent">Drama</div>
      <div class="indent">Sports</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div onclick="toggle();">
    Radio Shows
    <div>
      <div class="indent">News</div>
      <div class="indent">Soap</div>
      <div class="indent">Sports</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Requirement 3: Ensuring that Assistive Technologies can understand what state a UI component is in

If you ARIA's `role` property to create components that HTML alone can't express, you will often need to use `aria-` attributes to express the properties and states of those components. For example:

- Use `aria-selected` to express whether a `li role="tab"` element is the tab that is currently active within its `ul role="tablist"` parent.
- Use `aria-expanded` to express whether a component that opens and closes is currently expanded.
- Use `aria-checked` to express the state of switch component you've built with `button role="switch"`

The HTML code of custom controls (e.g. sliders, tabs, accordions) should the right ARIA attributes to describe their role and status (e.g. tab, slider, selected, expanded, collapsed).

#### Common mistakes

- A button is used as the trigger to disclose content, but the `aria-expanded` attribute has not been used to communicate the disclosure component’s current state;

### Remember: an ARIA `role` is just a promise. You need to implement the keyboard support yourself

The `role` and `aria-` only tell Assistive Technologies how to announce a component to screen reader users. The keyboard interactions that are implied by different ARIA `role`s are still for you to implement.

For example, let's imagine that you're building a button using `div role="button"`, rather than using the native HTML `button` or `input type="button"` elements:

- `role="button"` implies that this component is a button. Buttons can be activated using the 'Enter' and 'Space' keys. You will need to implement responses to these key presses yourself.
- `div role="button"` doesn't automatically place that pseudo-button in the page's [tab order](./definitions.md#tab-order), which means that users couldn't reach it using the `Tab` key. You'd need to remember to add that yourself too, by adding the `tabindex="0"` attribute.

  Note: it's much better to use `button` or `input type="button"` as they come with keyboard support built-in.

### More guidance for Web

#### W3C specifications and guidance documents

- Look at the [W3C ARIA in HTML document](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/) to see:

  - [what aria `role` is allowed on each HTML element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#document-conformance-requirements-for-use-of-aria-attributes-in-html);
  - [what each aria `role` value means, and what `aria-` attributes you should/may use with it](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-aria-roles-states-and-properties).

- Read the [W3C Using ARIA document](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/) to know the "[5 rules of ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#NOTES)" and understand a bit more about ARIA before creating custom components with ARIA.

- The [ARIA 1.1 specification document](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) has a lot of information about how to use each ARIA `role` and `aria-` attributes.

- The [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) is a great document that tells you how to implement a broad range of very common UI patterns (e.g. tabs, switches, toggles, dialog, feed, etc) with lots of details and working examples. It tells you:
  - What keyboard support you need to implement to meet users’ expectations (which are largely set by how the same patterns are implemented in operating systems)
  - How to build these components using ARIA. (But be careful to read the document's ['Read me first' section](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#read_me_first) if you intend to reuse these coding patterns as is)
