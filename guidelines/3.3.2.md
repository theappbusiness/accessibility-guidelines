## Summary

**Provide labels to make it clear how users should fill a form, and optionally provide extra hints to help them avoid errors.**

Form fields (like a text input or a checkbox) should have a clear label and instructions.

---

## Requirements

### Labels

* All labels in a form clearly and precisely describe the data required from users;

### Required fields

* Fields that are mandatory are clearly indicated (for example with the text "Required").
  * Alternatively, the labels of non-mandatory fields include the text “(Optional)” when most fields are mandatory.

### Additional instructions

* Additional instructions are provided for fields that require data to be entered in a specific format.
  * Instructions should be included in the label or displayed next to the field;
  * Instructions should be properly associated in code with the relevant form field.

### Common mistakes

*   Data is expected in a specific format, but no instructions have been provided;
*   Instructions have been provided, but they are not associated with the relevant field.

### Why?

Labels help all users to understand what a form control is and what is being asked for. And they are essential for users who cannot easily determine this by looking at the form and surrounding content.

Following this guideline ensures that everyone understands any requirements for entering data, and that screen reader users are made aware of it.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.3.2 Labels or Instructions:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html) [Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html#labeldef) or instructions are provided when content requires user input. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* All form controls, such as text inputs, check boxes, select lists, or buttons, must each have a unique label that stays visible.
* Don't use text placeholders as a replacement for the label of text inputs, or to give additional instructions. This is because:
  * Placeholder text disappears as soon as text is entered in the field. This makes it impossible for users to check whether they've entered text in the right way.
  * Placeholder text doesn't have enough contrast;
  * Placeholder text makes it hard at a glance to see that a text input field needs filling;
  * On the Web, the `placeholder` attribute doesn't reliably provide `input` elements with an ['Accessible Name'](./definitions.md#accessible-name).

## Guidance for Web

### Associating a `label` with an `input`

```html
<label for="uname">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="uname" />
```

#### Failure example

```html
<div>
  Username: 
  <input type="text" id="uname" />
</div>
```

### Associating a hint with a text input field using `aria-describedby`

```html
<label for="national-insurance-number">
  National Insurance number
</label>

<span id="national-insurance-number-hint">
  It’s on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
</span>

<input id="national-insurance-number" name="national-insurance-number" type="text"
aria-describedby="national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error">

<span id="national-insurance-number-error">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Error:</span> Enter a National Insurance number in the correct format
</span>
```
